      <p>Let the journey begin:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>I started out school as an Architrectural Design major. I completed a four year degree but I wasn't completely sold by architectural design. This was my opening into the world, but it was merely a stepping stone. </li>
          <li>The next venture I jumped into was Digital Marketing. This is where I learned all about business, risk, and return. I would say that digital marketing was a very thrilling puzzle that had to be adjusted with every industry and business owner.</li>
          <li>Now I am jumping into coding and I hope to become a producer of apps, software, and beautiful UX/UI design. I know that this is a profession that requires teamwork from the clientele to the coding experts. I will be ready to work on any team and jump into my next project. I am excited to start this journey towards a whole new world!</li>
      </ul>
