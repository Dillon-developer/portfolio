      <p>Let the journey begin:</p>
      <ul>
          <p>I started out school as an Architrectural Design major. I completed a four year degree but I wasn't completely sold by architectural design. This was my opening into the world, but it was merely a stepping stone. </p>
          <p>The next venture I jumped into was Digital Marketing. This is where I learned all about business, risk, and return. I would say that digital marketing was a very thrilling puzzle that had to be adjusted with every industry and business owner.</p>
          <p>Now I am jumping into coding and I hope to become a producer of apps, software, and beautiful UX/UI design. I am excited to start this journey towards a whole new world!</p>
